# Project One w/ Revature

## A-Team Revature Expense Reimbursement Company

### Discription of our program

The Expense Reimbursement System manages the process of all employee 
Reimbursement request incurred while on company time.

Every employee is a user. All employees of the company can log in and 
submit requests for reimbursement. They can also view their past 
individual history of pending, approved, or denied requests.

Managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and the 
history of past, pending, and submitted requests. Managers are 
authorized to approve or deny all reimbursement requests. 
Additionally, managers are in charge of setting up a new user 
and deleting someone who no longer works with us.

# Roles and Responsibilities
I was the lead for this project. I organized the meetings, 
confirmed times to meet with everyone, and scheduled our 
Zoom calls. I led the discussions and brought up topics 
of concern. I continued to ask for their input.

While actively listening to the other two members, I took 
meeting notes. I set the next meeting agenda, asking for their 
comments, concerns, and questions at the beginning of the meeting. 

One of the members dropped out of the project, and the other
said they would not help with servlets. I coded html, CSS, Java 
and MySQL. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to finish coding the project. 

I drew up diagrams which included flowcharts, and ERD Diagrams.
I coded in Visual Code for the HTML and CSS pages over the first weekend. 
On Monday, I received clarification that the project had to be 
programmed in IntelliJ, so I switched over.

# Lessons Learned

Some lessons that I learned from this project; Confirm what 
environments we are using at the beginning.

Ask the team their expected hours to work on the project and not 
expect everyone to dedicate themselves to a project as I do. 
We are not equal in dedication.
